# ttTools
## All the stuff you wish turntable.fm already had.

ttTools is a lightweight, small, un-intrusive plugin for turntable.fm that aims to provide an enhanced user experience. 

## Solid Feature Set
Despite what you may have heard, ttTools is much more than an "auto-clicker". ttTools provides numerous added functions to the turntable.fm platform in a seamless, easy to use interface.  
* Guestlist Integration w/ Vote Indicators, Idle Markers, +more!
* Auto Awesome/Lame w/ Cached Switch & Cached Variable Delay
* Auto DJ w/ Cached Switch, Cached Variable Delay & Auto-Off
* Playlist Filtering
* More!

## Easy To Use

To add the bookmark manually:

*   Create a bookmark in your bookmarks bar named ttTools  
*   For the location, enter:  
        `javascript:(function(){document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('script')).src='https://raw.github.com/JNehlsen/ttTools/master/releases/latest/ttTools.js';})();
`  
*   After entering a turntable.fm room, click the ttTools bookmark.

## Found a bug? Want a feature?
It's impossible to keep track of bugs and feature requests unless they're centralized. [Please submit all bugs and feature requests here.](https://github.com/egeste/ttTools/issues)

* I will do my best to keep this updated as TT changes.
* I know next to nothing about chrome extensions, so the extension will not work for the time-being. The bookmarklet does.
* <b>Toggle Animations dosen't fully work</b>, and until further notice that feature is discontinued.
* <b>Tagging dosen't work fully</b>, and until further notice that feature is discontinued.
